# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Zhou Xin.

## ðŸš€ About Me

I'm a graduate student at the School of Software Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), and currently an intern [@PaddlePaddle](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle) Baidu.

My passion lies in the field of AI systems and frameforks, eagerly learning and growing with each new challenge.

I maintain a personal blog at [https://zhouxin.space](https://zhouxin.space), where I share my learning notes and insights. It's a collection of my journey in AI. Feel free to visit and leave comments!
